🌀 Introducing AEra – The Resonant Standard (not another token)
"In a world obsessed with price, we built something that measures alignment."

Hey everyone 👋

We've just open-sourced AEra Token — a verified, fully transparent ERC-20 contract on Ethereum (currently Sepolia Testnet) — designed not as a speculation vehicle, but as a resonance experiment:

**Can digital systems reflect human integrity, precision, and collaboration instead of greed?**

## 🧩 Why We're Doing This

Most tokens talk about value.
We talk about **resonance** — the signal that emerges when technology, ethics, and clarity vibrate on the same frequency.

AEra isn't trying to compete with coins. It's trying to create **trust without narrative manipulation.**
